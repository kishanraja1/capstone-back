1. Front end live link: https://fierce-retreat-92206.herokuapp.com/
2. Back end live link: https://salty-oasis-93120.herokuapp.com/api/stocks
3. Front end repo: https://github.com/kishanraja1/capfront

## Technologies Used

The technologies used on the back end are:
### SpringBoot
### SpringBoot Starter Data JPA
### PostgreSQL
### SpringBoot Maven
### Postman

## Approach Taken
1. Use Spring Initializr for starter code.
2. Create Controller and Service layers of the API.
3. Use Spring Data JPA to set up a repository, which translates PostgreSQL commands to Java code
4. Deploy after cleaning and creating a jar file.

## Unsolved Problems

Spring Security is a key part of this project, but was not successfully integrated due to time constraints. It is worth continuing efforts to include Spring Security.

## Notes to Self

This project does not have a spring security dependency. Ensure the dependency is installed and then continue efforts to implement Spring Security.
